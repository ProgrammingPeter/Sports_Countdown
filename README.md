Sports_Countdown
================

A website designed to show you a countdown until the next sporting event for professional teams and athletes.

At first only the NBA section is working and all other links are dead, but they will be coming soon!

My first personal project tinkering with web development.

At first this project was being done in HTML,CSS,JS, and some help from Ruby, 
but while parsing the files I liked the language and how it worked so I decided to 
learn Ruby on Rails and redo the website using the rails framework.

The original html,css,js files are in "Connect to DB", and "Sports_Pages". 
Those files will be recycled in the rails version, once they are inserted into the rails 
version the old folders will be deleted.
